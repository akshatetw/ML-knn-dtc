Introduction:
Iris Classification: Iris is the family in the flower which contains the several species such as the iris.setosa, iris.versicolor, iris.virginica, etc. We can classify iris flower into its different types on the basis of its petal width, length,etc.
Tools Used: Google Colab
Algorithm: k-nearest neighbour algorithm
                    Distance tree classification algorithm
Conclusion:
ML model is successfully developed for the Iris dataset given, using 75% of given data for training ML model and 25% of data for the testing of the model.
Using knn algorithm, with nearest neighbour equal to 5, the accuracy of ML model is 97.36%
Using dtc algorithm, with initialising a random state, the accuracy of ML model is 97.36%
Thus, accuracy of the model build is same using both the algorithms.
